Some of my core mottos.

**"Do what you think is right, 
   keep your direction and 
   never be swayed easily 
   but
   listen to advice,
   practice compassion and
   build trust."**
   
**"Never be afraid of the next adventure 
   even if outside of your comfort zone.
   Embrace discomfort as your new comfort.
   That is the way of pioneers."**

**"Smile, smile a lot
   and stay on top of things.
   Smile with dignity 
   to the World 
   as well as 
   to Your-very-self."**
