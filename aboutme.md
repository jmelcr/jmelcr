<HR>

Discovering new paths and directions 
is one of the main driving forces in my research. 
I especially like introducing fresh perspectives, new points of view. 
Approaching projects from different angles 
helps me to stay on top of things - because -
being on top of things is an attribute I find in many great scientists.
