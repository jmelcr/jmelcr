# Current projects

- **Permeability of biological membranes:**
accurate exerimental measurements of small solutes permeability gets explained by MD simulations.
Will we open new ways to drug delivery?


- **Martini 3:**
Development of the new Martini 3 lipids. 
I am coordinating an international group of researchers to 
develp the next generation of highly popular 
[Martini Coarse-grained model](https://scholar.google.cz/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&qsp=3&q=martini+coarse&qst=ib) for lipids. 
Our standard is remote working,
we get things done through motivation
and close collaboration of experts from diverse fields across the globe.
[GitLab] is our workhorse to communicate, keep synchronized and work together â€“ 
Asynchronously in our work time, 
yet in synchrony with the work done.


- **MeMBrane project: Enhancing industrial bioprocesses in yeast and bacteria via membrane optimization**
[MeMBrane project](https://www.membrane.org.uk/) 
aims at improving and creating possible new industries using cell factories and biomass. 
Our role in the consortium is to provide molecular-level understanding of the processes at cellular membranes
and assist in guiding the laboratory evolution of the engineered microbes. 


- **ECC-lipids - implicitly polarizable lipid models showing accurate interactions with ionic molecules**
ECC-lipids is the first MD model to implicitly account for polarizability in molecules. 
Will it launch [a new "polarizable" era of MD modeling](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00143/full)?
Current development of ECC-lipids is held in the [GitHub repository ecc_lipids](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids)
with a separate [web page with documentation](https://jmelcr.github.io/ecc_lipids/).

# Past projects


- **Determination of protein sctructure with optical polarization microscopy**
Polarization microscopy allows sensitive observations of changes in protein conformation in living cells and organisms ([ref.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp4067026)). 
For fluorescent proteins with a resolved structure, 
it is possible to link the polarization microscopy measurements and 
[transition dipole moment](http://www.nh.cas.cz/people/lazar/celler/tdm.php) orientations
to protein strucutre. 
Quantum mechanical calculations of absorption properties and 
molecular dynamics simulations
are used as a guide and an independent verifying instrument for such a technique. 
This project is run in a close collaboration with the group of [Josef Lazar](https://www.uochb.cz/web/structure/1408.html?lang=en). 


- **Transmembrane potential modeling in molecular simulation**
All eukaryotic cells maintain a nonzero transmembrane potential across their plasma membranes. It is a crucial feature for many kinds of our organs, e.g. brain, heart, pancreas.
In this project, I assay current approaches for the modeling of transmembrane potential in molecular simulation.
Published in Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 12 (5), 2016. DOI: [10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202).


- **Development of membrane-bound probes of cellular functions**
We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally develop probes of cellular functions, 
especially neural activity. Such probes are intended to work with accurate polarization microscopy measurements, 
which can detect their structural changes.
Development of fluorescent molecular probes of cell membrane voltage promises to deliver the ability
of observing the electrical activity of neuronal assemblies using an optical microscope. 
This project is run in a close collaboration with the group of [Josef Lazar](https://www.uochb.cz/web/structure/1408.html?lang=en). 

-  Development of classical force field parameters for organometallic compounds compatible with Amber force field.

-  Enzymatic activity of EF-Tu, a protein factor that takes part in the process of translation on the Ribozome.
