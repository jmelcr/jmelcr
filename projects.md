# Projects

## Current projects

- **ECC-lipids - implicitly polarizable lipid models showing accurate interactions with ionic molecules**
Sodium and Calcium are highly biologically relevant cations. Current (2017) classical MD lipid models, however, overestimate binding of cations even to neutral phosphocholine bilayers. 
In this project, we identified electronic polarization as the missing key phenomenon responsible for the artifacts. 
We applied an implicit mean-field model of polarizability 
(Electronic Continuum Correction, ECC) 
on top of Lipid14 model yielding [ECC-POPC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12510), 
a new lipid model that accounts for electronic polarization and accurately describes interactions with ions.

Current development is held in GitHub repository [ecc_lipids](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids).
ECC-POPC is already [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12510) 
and can be also reached in a separate 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ohsOllila/NMRlipids_VI-NewIonModel)
resp [my fork](https://github.com/jmelcr/NMRlipids_VI-NewIonModel). 

## Past projects

- **Transmembrane potential modeling in molecular simulation**
All eukaryotic cells maintain a nonzero transmembrane potential across their plasma membranes. It is a crucial feature for many kinds of our organs, e.g. brain, heart, pancreas.
In this project, I assay current approaches for the modeling of transmembrane potential in molecular simulation.

Development of membrane-bound probes of cellular functions
We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally develop probes of cellular functions, especially neural activity. Such probes are intended to work with accurate polarization microscopy measurements, which can detect their structural changes.


-  Development of classical force field parameters for organometallic compounds compatible with Amber force field.
