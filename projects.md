# Past projects

- **Transmembrane potential modeling in molecular simulation**
All eukaryotic cells maintain a nonzero transmembrane potential across their plasma membranes. It is a crucial feature for many kinds of our organs, e.g. brain, heart, pancreas.
In this project, I assay current approaches for the modeling of transmembrane potential in molecular simulation.
Published in Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 12 (5), 2016. DOI: [10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202).


- **Development of membrane-bound probes of cellular functions**
We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally develop probes of cellular functions, 
especially neural activity. Such probes are intended to work with accurate polarization microscopy measurements, 
which can detect their structural changes.
Development of fluorescent molecular probes of cell membrane voltage promises to deliver the ability
of observing the electrical activity of neuronal assemblies using an optical microscope. 

-  Development of classical force field parameters for organometallic compounds compatible with Amber force field.
Picture

-  Enzymatic activity of EF-Tu, a protein factor that takes part in the process of translation on the Ribozome.
