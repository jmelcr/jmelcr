ðŸ—’ *Starting Wednesday update message series*
Hello everyone!

Almost a year ago, 
I have started this group chat 
to allow for an easy and less formal communication than by email, 
to make at least a small substitute to the change in our _usual_ communication.

During the free time in the past weeks, 
I got an idea to start writing a weekly Wednesday update message
to bring back a bit of a human feeling to our communication. 
Writing a short personal story about _how we are_
is the best we can do to start _the ad-hoc conversations_
we have enjoyed in corridors and during coffee breaks in Linnaeusborg. 

I plan to write a few sentences about ... 
whatever days bring in my way,
both work-related and totally unrelated. 
ðŸ‘‰ I would be delighted if you join this activity with your own writing â€”
after all, the purpose is to have a group chat, not a one person monologue!

*But why choose writing?*
Because writing is among the available means of communication 
still the best tool to put down ideas, think, reflect on them and yourself and ...
and there are numerous other benefits to writing, 
e.g. take a look here for a few hints:

(No. 1 in the list is not to be underestimated especially these days!)




And this is my first post, enjoy!
(looking forward to see yours!)


*Josef 6-Jan 2021*

The Monday after the Christmas break has hit our daily routines *hard*, right in the morning. 

We have just barely passed the winter solstice.
Mornings are basically beginning only at around eight-thirty with the first hints of sunlight,
but eight-thirty is also the time of the first school video-lessons!
Huh! I got so used to waking up with the sunlight outside the window over the past few weeks...
Now, a buzzer is needed to get everyone up
(I admit, both parents and children have trubles with this)
and the breakfast needs to rush a bit, too. 
(it was better when we could take it easy)

I was genuinely surprised to see that the video-lessons for the year 2 children
(I think that is about groep 3 in the Dutch system) 
are working quite well.
Our, parents, intervention is needed now and then to open/close microphone 
or solve burning problems of the kind "Where is my teacher?" 
(the window with the video-lesson _magically_ goes out of the screen)
In between our "Daddy, help" interventions,
we try to work and make our morning coffee. 
We drink lots of coffee.

Well, that's how it goes!
