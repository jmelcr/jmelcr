*It used to be better back then in 2021*

Back then in 2021, there was still snow in winter and the canals froze from time to time. 
You could go skating on them and do a bit of sledging on the canal edges â€“ the only "slope" around; 
that has not changed. 
I remember one day, when I made us two cups of espresso, 
went out with them to the beautiful sunny day and pretended we are skiing in Alps. 
It was a great day.
