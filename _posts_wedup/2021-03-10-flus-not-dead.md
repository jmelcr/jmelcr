_Common flu is not dead_

It is Saturday and we are arranging a play date on Sunday for kids in school when Hermina comes complaining about a sore throat. One hour later, message from class chat comes that some kids will be missing on Monday describing similar symptoms. Oh no, that's no fun. No play, no school. 
Everything seems getting better until my throat feels sore too. Oh no, that's no fun. 

You know, we have a saying in Czechia that the  common flu is the harshest disease for men (we literally call it "small flu" or "grieptje"). And this terrible monster got me on Monday. But don't worry, I got tested (negative) and I am getting better. 

I have noticed the machines were offline for some time – thanks for kicking the power button on md39!

And now on a more positive note – we are organizing a conference in Utrecht. ICBL2021 - all about biophysics of lipids - that may be interested to some! Feel free to spread the news, the website with more details is now online:

(tell me if you miss some information!)

Let me brag a bit: I made the logos and the design.

Enjoy!
