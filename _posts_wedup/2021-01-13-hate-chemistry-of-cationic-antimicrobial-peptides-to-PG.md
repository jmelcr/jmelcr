*On the hate-chemistry of cationic peptides to PG membranes*

Who does remember the topic of my last group meeting?
_thinking ... thinking ... thinking_ ...

OK, I'll tell you. 
It was the antimicrobial peptidomimetics. 
And I think we have achieved with Adéla quite a good progress since last time. 

Things are making a good sense –
simulations and experiments complement each other like in _pas de deux_
and there are even recent works
that support some of our findings on similar systems!
I mean the following "just accepted" JCTC2021 
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01025
which explicitly demonstrates that 
cationic antimicrobial peptides are attracted 
by membrane negative charge via PG lipids –
which is also one of the early findings in our work. 

In our study, we use one particluar modified peptide AMC,
which has a very similar design to the antimicrobial peptides - 
there is a cationic part and a hydrophobic part.
You may think of it as a _very strange cationic lipid._ 
(well, cationic makes it strange enough already ...)
I am proud that even though this project started as mostly experimental,
the simulations progressed so fast 
that the simulation results now glue the experimental findings together very well
and thus became one of the basic methods in this study. 

This is possible in one part 
thanks to the relatively _"quick-n-easy"_ way 
of developing new prototype models for molecules in Martini (3).
In other part, my simulations in this project 
are largely scripted, i.e. semi-automated,
which makes it (again) _quick-n-easy_ to scale the simulations up
for independent runs, conditions, chemical compositions ...

This way, I could compare several antimicrobial agents;
melittin, BP100 (adopted from Peter, thanks!) and AMC. 
Interestingly, their perturbing effects to the membrane also go in this order
as sketched in the following infographic – enjoy =]


Well, that's how it goes! _(scientifically)_
