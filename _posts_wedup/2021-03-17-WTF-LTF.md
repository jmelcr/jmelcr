*WTF? LTF!*

Yesterday we have discussed about the work that was done in LTF,
_the Lipid Task Force,_
and I realized 
that it is quite a lot of work 
that we managed in the past few weeks!
In today's post I would like to give you a glimpse into the kitchen...

First of all, let me thank Petteri for his work and effort he put into the task. 
He has performed a systematic series of AA reference simulations of alkanes of variable lengths,
in water as well as in melt, all in two force fields!
This gives us quite a dataset to benchmark the preogressed CG Martini 3 models of alkanes,
the future lipid tails! 
If anyone is interested in taking a look at such simulations, 
they are available at the following Zenodo deposits
