*Inhomogenous pace of time*

The time flies by so quickly 
that it feels almost like yesterday 
when I was writing about the exciting research with peptides
in my previous message. 
_How come it passed so quickly?_ 
Because since then, we were ... simply busy. 

Prepare for meetings. 
Be at the meetings. 
Write papers. 
Raise children. 
Emails. _(this pile is neverending!!)_
Cook dinner. 
Home-schooling.
Do some work ...


At least there are weekends. 
It is the only time we finally do not feel that much pressure from work 
and can allow ourselves to relax. 
Our girls feel it too â€“ they suddenly recognize weekend as the days 
they do not have to spend that much time at a table 
and do not have to attend tele-classes at precise scheduled times
and can play freely as they please.
(Oh, how nicely they can do that!)
How much they miss playing with their friends!
There is tension everywhere during the work week 
and by the time we start cooking dinner,
we feel exhausted. 

At least there are weekends
to let some steam off. 
And workweek evenings. 
We usually keep them for our leisure time
to remain sane humans
and rejuvenate for the next day. 

Last week, we have spent one evening 
watching a very nice episode from the Star Trek series Voyager. 
(Did you only know I am a fan of Star Trek?)
The starship enters a void, which seems to span such a vast territory 
that the crew will have almost nothing to do for the next several months. 
A mental breakdown of even the strongest minds in the crew 
is suddenly a major threat to the whole ship ...
What a pregnant sci-fi story about 30 years old for today's context!
But don't worry, it has a happy ending ðŸ˜‰
Intrigued? 
It's on Netflix in NL, Season 5, episode 1, title "Night". 
Definitely worth a look!


Well, that's how it goes â€“
Live long and prosper! ðŸ––
