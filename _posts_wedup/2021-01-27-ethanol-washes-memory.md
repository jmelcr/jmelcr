*Ethanol washes memory*

Sounds like common sense, doesn't it:
_Ethanol washes memory._
(like we did not know already, huh!)
The funny thing is 
that it seems to work even at a cellular level.


My main project is to describe
how yeast cell membranes are affected by ethanol
and possibly propose membrane modifications, 
which would protect the cells against it and improve fermentation. 
Initially, we have thought 
that fortifying the cells by hard impenetrable membranes
would secure them better than their current state. 

It was a great surprise to me
that the yeast cells especially 
seem already quite fortified as they are.
Their cell plasma membranes contain special rigid structures
and large parts of its lipids form a gel phase - or something close to it
as the membrane is far from a "simple" ternary mixture. 
What a surprise it was
when we also found experimentally
that the yeast strains with more fluid membranes 
are actually more ethanol tolerant than those with more rigid membranes ‚Äì
how confusing!


I did not know where to start;
the knowledge was rather confusing than leading me to some clear conclusion. 
So, I though to myself ...

_When you do not know what to do about it, do it at least systematically!_

And this way I have arrived at a consistent set of hundreds of simple membrane compositions
which span all Lo, Ld and gel phases.
Through semi-automated scripts, I have a Martini-based description of their basic properties. 
Such a consistent data set is well suited for large data analysis and machine learning approaches. 

In the moving gif picture attached to this post
there is an example plot of scaled properties
"zorder" (diagonal _zz_ component of the order parameter tensor) and
"APL" (you guess well, it is area per lipid). 
The colours denote the clusters of membranes with similar porpeties 
obtained from unsupervised machine learning (aka "clustering"). 
The first frame in the gif gives you a hint of what the clusters mean;
there are gel phases, Lo and Ld phases. 

And here comes the memory wash in three easy steps 
‚Äì Yeast plasma membrane contains those highly rigid parts 
which are purposefully distributed at specific places.
- Yeasts are living organisms maintaining their homeostasis 
including those rigid membrane structures. 
- Ethanol has the capacity to destabilize such structures 
and dissolve them into the "regular" fluid phases.

_Yeast: What happened? I do not remember anything. 
I was happily fermenting [producing ethanol] until ...
Hmmpf!_ üòî

Funny aspect ‚Äì 
having less to loose to the ethanol memory-whashing effects 
seems to protect the cells at yeast fermentation parties
as those yeasts with less "membrane-contained memory" (more fluid membranes overall)
seem to suffer less headaches from ethanol than those with more structured membranes.
Huh! üòÅ


Well, that's how it goes! 

PS We have recently moved to a larger place ‚Äì and it is gorgeous! 
Finally enough space for the whole family!
Yay!
