It does not look like that today, but in the past few days
it was possible to walk on some of the frozen canals!
Kids loved it,
we parents were a little terrified about the sound of cracking ice at the canal edges
(we calmed ourselves by saying that the canal is very very shallow)
and some ducks seemed a bit confused about their new skill

Right now, I am in the middle of my today's experiment –
what happens if you mix caffeine, rozijnbroodjes and chocomel 
with school activities, work and, of course, some [Martini](http://cgmartini.nl/).

👨‍💻 + 🧑‍🏫 + ☕️ + 🧇 + 🧋 + 🍸 = ?

Well, we will see at the end of today, 
what is the result of this chemical reaction.
So far, 
I had to assist some home-schooling self-assembly 
by "chaperoning" homework 
and kids-delivering to tele-classes (very endothermal transport process!). 
After lunch I hope to find some time for my own self-assembly
with at least one reaction side product –
digest mail in my over-filled mailbox.
Let's hope it will be a piece of cake!


Well, that's how it goes! 


PS I first wanted to call this post "homical reaction"
but got second thoughts after checking possible puns on the first word 😬😉
