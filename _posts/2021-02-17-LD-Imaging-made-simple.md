title:  "Molecular antennae made easily visible by Linear Dichroism Imaging"

I am excited to announce that after about 7 years
my work with antennae in fluorescent proteins is (finally!) published!
ðŸ¥³

Luckily, we have chosen a broad enough topic for 
[my PhD thesis](https://jmelcr.github.io/blog/doc-thesis) 
so that we could fill it with other research, 
that went a bit quicker.

The title of the new publication is 
[_Quantitative linear dichroism imaging of molecular processes in living cells made simple by open software tools_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01694-1) â€” 
that does not sound like a paper with MD at all, does it? 
Yes, it presents mostly the developed tools that 
allow easy and user friendly analysis of the images from polarization microscopy. 
Indeed, the most difficult part is "only" taking the microscopy images and preparing the samples â€“
see how easy is to use the plugin in action in 
[this video](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42003-021-01694-1/MediaObjects/42003_2021_1694_MOESM4_ESM.mp4)

I have also helped with the development of the statistical part of the 
[ImageJ plugin](https://github.com/jlazarlab/polarization_microscopy_macros),
but where is the MD work?
We used MD simulations as an independent protein structure tool
to help us shape the distributions in the statistical analysis part of the tool. 
This is shown in 
[Figure 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01694-1#Fig6),
where we compare our results from MD simulations and polarization microscopy. 
Bonus points to the [Martini coarse-grained model](http://cgmartini.nl/)
that allowed us to do this!
