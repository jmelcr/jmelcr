The weather in February was as Dutch is it could get â€”
so high variance!

It all started with frozen canals, skating and building snowmen. 
There even were two subsequent Mondays, 
when the school was closed due to the freezing weather. 
What a surprise to find ourselves 
only two weeks later
under a beautiful clear sunny sky!

The weather forecast for today promised a nice sunny day, too. 
I planned to take kids from school directly for a picnic 
and maybe spend some time at a playground,
maybe some roller-skating. 

_But if you want to make gods laugh, tell them about your plans for the future._

Cold and foggy, that's what we've got instead. 
But did we feel down? No.

When we could not get the promised sunshine from the sky,
[we painted it ourselves in our minds.](https://jmelcr.tumblr.com/post/644639001419055104/sunshine-in-my-mind)
It does not matter that much how the weather actually was,
it matters how we see it, how we approach it. 
And we enjoyed our afternoon anyways. 
In defiance. 

Well, that's how it goes!
