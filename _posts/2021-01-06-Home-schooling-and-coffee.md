The Monday after the Christmas break has hit our daily routines *hard*, right in the morning. 

We have just barely passed the winter solstice.
Mornings are basically beginning only at around eight-thirty with the first hints of sunlight,
but eight-thirty is also the time of the first school video-lessons!
Huh! I got so used to waking up with the sunlight outside the window over the past few weeks...
Now, a buzzer is needed to get everyone up
(I admit, both parents and children have trubles with this)
and the breakfast needs to rush a bit, too. 
(it was better when we could take it easy)

I was genuinely surprised to see that the video-lessons for the year 2 children
(I think that is about groep 3 in the Dutch system) 
are working quite well.
Our, parents, intervention is needed now and then to open/close microphone 
or solve burning problems of the kind "Where is my teacher?" 
(the window with the video-lesson _magically_ goes out of the screen)
In between our "Daddy, help" interventions,
we try to work and make our morning coffee. 
We drink lots of coffee.

Well, that's how it goes!
