# Welcome!
This is my home page,
where I keep a simple [blog](blog), 
collect my work, thoughts, ideas ... 
anything I find interesting. 
Here below are some examples of what can be found here â€”
are you interested in ...

### my scientific work?
My work in scientific research 
already requires to be split across several pages.
So, depending on what you are looking for, 
you shall consider taking a look
at my [Projects](projects)
or at 
my [About me page](aboutme). 
Or was it just a [list of publications?](publications)

**More into coding and computing?**
Then you may like to see 
my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/jmelcr)!


### my arts, photography and writing?
I usually collect 
my arts, thoughts and mindful writing 
elsewhere, namely on 
my 
[Tumblr](https://jmelcr.tumblr.com/)
or
[Medium](https://medium.com/@jmelcr) 
blog profiles. 
But some works are also placed
in [my blog](blog) here on GH pages!
